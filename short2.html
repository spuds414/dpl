<h2>Jesus Prayer </h2>
<p>Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God,<br>
have mercy on me, a sinner.</p>
 
<h2>Confession of Sin</h2>
<p>Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name.<br>
Amen.</p>

<h2>Prayer for Mercy</h2> 
<p>Lord, have mercy.<br>
Christ, have mercy.<br>
Lord, have mercy.</p>


<h2>Jesus Prayer</h2> 
<p>Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God,<br>
have mercy on me, a sinner.</p>



<h2>Lord’s Prayer</h2>
<p>Our Father, who art in heaven,<br>
hallowed by thy Name,<br>
Thy kingdom come,<br>
Thy will be done,<br>
on earth as it is in heaven.<br>
Give us this day our daily bread.<br>
And forgive us our trespasses,<br>
as we forgive those who trespass against us.<br>
And lead us not into temptation,<br>
but deliver us from evil.<br>
For thine is the kingdom,<br> 
And the power, and the glory,<br>
forever. Amen.<br>

have mercy on me, a sinner.</p>
 
<h2>The Beatitudes</h2>
<p>Blessed are the poor in spirit,<br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.<br>
Blessed are those who mourn,<br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  for they shall be comforted.<br>
Blessed are the meek,<br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  for they shall inherit the earth.<br>
Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for justice,<br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  for they shall be satisfied.<br>
Blessed are the merciful,<br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  for they shall receive mercy.<br>
Blessed are the pure in heart,<br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  for they shall see God.<br>
Blessed are the peacemakers,<br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  for they shall be called children of God.<br>
Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness sake,<br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</p>

<h2>Prayer of St. Francis</h2>
<p>Lord, make me an instrument of your peace.<br>
Where there is hatred, let me sow love;<br>
Where there is injury, pardon;<br>
Where there is doubt, faith;<br>
Where there is despair, hope;<br>
Where there is darkness, light;<br>
Where there is sadness, joy.<br>
O divine Master, grant that I may not so much seek<br>
to be consoled as to console,<br>
to be understood as to understand,<br>
to be loved as to love;<br>
For it is in giving that we receive;<br>
it is in pardoning that we are pardoned;<br>
it is in dying to self that we are born to eternal life.<br>
Amen.</p>


<h2>Canticle of Zechariah (Luke 1:68–79)</h2>
<p>Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel;<br>
he has come to his people and set them free.<br>
He has raised up for us a mighty savior,<br>
born of the house of his servant David.</p>

<p>Through his holy prophets he promised of old<br>
that he would save us from our enemies,<br>
from the hands of all who hate us.<br>
He promised to show mercy to our fathers<br>
and to remember his holy covenant.</p>

<p>This was the oath he swore to our father Abraham:<br>
to set us free from the hands of our enemies,<br>
free to worship him without fear,<br>
holy and righteous in his sight all the days of our life.</p>

<p>You, my child, shall be called the prophet of the Most High;<br>
for you will go before the Lord to prepare his way,<br>
to give his people knowledge of salvation<br>
by the forgiveness of their sins.</p>

<p>In the tender compassion of our God<br>
the dawn from on high shall break upon us,<br>
to shine on those who dwell in darkness and the shadow of death,<br>
and to guide our feet into the way of peace.</p>
 
<h2>Gloria Patri</h2>
<p>Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit:<br>
as it was in the beginning is now, and will be forever. Amen.</p>

<h2>Confession of the Mystery</h2>
<p>Christ has died.<br>
Christ is risen.<br>
Christ will come again.</p>

<h2>Jesus Prayer</h2>
<p>Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God,<br>
