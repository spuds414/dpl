We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>

<h2>Apostle’s Creed</h2>
<p>I believe in God, the Father almighty,<br>
Creator of heaven and earth.<br>
I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord.<br>
He was conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit<br>
and born of the Virgin Mary.<br>
He suffered under Pontius Pilate,<br>
was crucified, died, and was buried.<br>
He descended to the dead.<br>
On the third day he rose again.<br>
He ascended into heaven,<br>
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.<br>
He will come again to judge the living and the dead.<br>
I believe in the Holy Spirit,<br>
the holy catholic Church,<br>
the communion of saints,<br>
the forgiveness of sins,<br>
the resurrection of the body,<br>
and the life everlasting. Amen</p>

hallowed by thy Name,<br>
Thy kingdom come,<br>
Thy will be done,<br>

Give us this day our daily bread.<br>
And forgive us our trespasses,<br>
as we forgive those who trespass against us.<br>
And lead us not into temptation,<br>
but deliver us from evil.<br>
For thine is the kingdom,<br> 
And the power, and the glory,<br>
forever. Amen.<br>

<h2>Prayer for Peace</h2>
<p>O God, you have made of one blood all the peoples of the earth, and sent your blessed Son to preach peace to those who are far off and to those who are near: Grant that people everywhere may seek after you and find you; bring the nations into your fold; pour out your Spirit upon all flesh; and hasten the coming of your kingdom; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</p>

<h2>Prayer of St. Francis</h2>
<p>Lord, make me an instrument of your peace.<br>
Where there is hatred, let me sow love;<br>
Where there is injury, pardon;<br>
Where there is doubt, faith;<br>
Where there is despair, hope;<br>
Where there is darkness, light;<br>
Where there is sadness, joy.<br>
O divine Master, grant that I may not so much seek<br>
to be consoled as to console,<br>
to be understood as to understand,<br>
to be loved as to love;<br>
For it is in giving that we receive;<br>
it is in pardoning that we are pardoned;<br>
it is in dying to self that we are born to eternal life.<br>
Amen.</p>

<h2>Prayer for the Week</h2>

<h2>Prayer for Grace</h2>
<p>Lord God, almighty and everlasting Father, you have brought us in safety to this new day: Preserve us with your mighty power, that we may not fall into sin, nor be overcome by adversity; and in all we do, direct us to the fulfilling of your purpose; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</p>
 

<h2>Canticle of Zechariah (Luke 1:68–79)</h2>
<p>Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel;<br>
he has come to his people and set them free.<br>
He has raised up for us a mighty savior,<br>
born of the house of his servant David.</p>

<p>Through his holy prophets he promised of old<br>
that he would save us from our enemies,<br>
from the hands of all who hate us.<br>
He promised to show mercy to our fathers<br>
and to remember his holy covenant.</p>

<p>This was the oath he swore to our father Abraham:<br>
to set us free from the hands of our enemies,<br>
free to worship him without fear,<br>
holy and righteous in his sight all the days of our life.</p>

<p>You, my child, shall be called the prophet of the Most High;<br>
for you will go before the Lord to prepare his way,<br>
to give his people knowledge of salvation<br>
by the forgiveness of their sins.</p>

<p>In the tender compassion of our God<br>
the dawn from on high shall break upon us,<br>
to shine on those who dwell in darkness and the shadow of death,<br>
and to guide our feet into the way of peace.</p>
 
<h2>Gloria Patri</h2>
<p>Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit:<br>
as it was in the beginning is now, and will be forever. Amen.</p>

<h2>Confession of the Mystery</h2>
<p>Christ has died.<br>
Christ is risen.<br>
Christ will come again.</p>

<h2>Jesus Prayer</h2>
<p>Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God,<br> 
have mercy on me, a sinner.</p>
